      Small footprint and configurable Inter-Chip
       communication cores powered by LiteX & Migen

[> Intro
--------
LiteICLink provides small footprint and configurable inter chip communication
cores.

LiteICLink is part of LiteX libraries whose aims are to lower entry level of
complex FPGA cores by providing simple, elegant and efficient implementations
of components used in today's SoC such as Ethernet, SATA, PCIe, SDRAM Controller...

Since Python is used to describe the HDL, the core is highly and easily
configurable.

LiteICLink is built using LiteX and uses technologies developed in partnership with
M-Labs Ltd:
 - Migen enables generating HDL with Python in an efficient way.
 - MiSoC provides the basic blocks to build a powerful and small footprint SoC.

LiteICLink can be used as LiteX library or can be integrated with your standard
design flow by generating the verilog rtl that you will use as a standard core.

[> Features
-----------
SERWB:
  - Wishbone over 3 LVDS pairs.
  - Artix7, Kintex7, Kintex Ultrascale support.
  - 8B/10B, integrated gearbox.
  - Up to 1.25Gbps linerate / 32 bits @ 31.25Mhz user interface.
  - Automatic sampling window adjustement at startup.
  - Encapsulated Etherbone protocol with buffered writes.

[> FPGA Proven
---------------
LiteICLink is already used in commercial and open-source designs:
- HDMI2USB: http://hdmi2usb.tv/home/
- and others commercial designs...

[> Possible improvements
------------------------
- add transceivers support.
- add support for Altera PHYs.
- add support for Lattice PHYs.
- add more documentation
- ... See below Support and consulting :)

If you want to support these features, please contact us at florent [AT]
enjoy-digital.fr.

[> Getting started
------------------
1. Install Python3 and your vendor's software

2. Obtain LiteX and install it:
  git clone https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex --recursive
  cd litex
  python3 setup.py develop
  cd ..

3. TODO: add/describe example design(s)

[> Tests
--------
Unit tests are available in ./test/.
To run all the unit tests:
  ./setup.py test
Tests can also be run individually:
  python3 -m unittest test.test_name

[> License
----------
LiteICLink is released under the very permissive two-clause BSD license. Under the
terms of this license, you are authorized to use LiteICLink for closed-source
proprietary designs.
Even though we do not require you to do so, those things are awesome, so please
do them if possible:
 - tell us that you are using LiteICLink
 - cite LiteICLink in publications related to research it has helped
 - send us feedback and suggestions for improvements
 - send us bug reports when something goes wrong
 - send us the modifications and improvements you have done to LiteICLink.

[> Support and consulting
-------------------------
We love open-source hardware and like sharing our designs with others.

LiteICLink is developed and maintained by EnjoyDigital.

If you would like to know more about LiteICLink or if you are already a happy user
and would like to extend it for your needs, EnjoyDigital can provide standard
commercial support as well as consulting services.

So feel free to contact us, we'd love to work with you! (and eventually shorten
the list of the possible improvements :)
